Please read all of my code base and help me add a new feature to my game. I would like to have a player character drawn at the center of the map. The player is a small ant and they move to wherever the player clicks.

Their sprites sheet is stored at assets/sprites/pc/ant_walk_sheet.png. the full sheet is 450 x 1800 and each sprite is 450 x 300 tall. The ant should cycle through their sprites while moving to simulate crawling. when not moving they should stay on pc0.png sprite.

The ant should be able to crawl about on all the faces of the prisms I have already drawn. the map that I have already drawn is larger than the screen, and when the ant gets near the edge of the screen I would like the map to move beneath the ant so that they remain on screen at all times.
