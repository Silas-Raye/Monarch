Please help me add a new feature to my pygame. I would like to have a player character drawn at the center of the map. The player is a small ant. Their sprites sheet is stored at assets/sprites/pc/ant_walk_sheet.png. the full sheet is 450 wide x 1800 tall and each sprite is 450 wide x 300 tall. there are 6 sprites on the sheet. The ant should cycle through their sprites if "moving" = true. when "moving" = false they should stay on the first sprite.

Here's a plan to implement the player character (ant):

1. Player Class: Create a Player class in a new file to manage the ant's state, including its position, sprite animation, and movement logic.

2. Sprite Sheet Handling: Implement a function to load and parse the ant's sprite sheet into a list of individual sprite surfaces.

3. Drawing the Player: A new function will be needed to draw the ant at its isometric position, handling sprite selection and animation.

The ant should be able to crawl about on all the faces of the prisms I have already drawn. the map that I have already drawn is larger than the screen, and when the ant gets near the edge of the screen I would like the map to move beneath the ant so that they remain on screen at all times.
